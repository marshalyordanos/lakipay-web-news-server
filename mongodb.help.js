// The error message you're encountering, "Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos," typically occurs when you're trying to use transactions in MongoDB but aren't connected to a replica set or a `mongos` (MongoDB shard server). 

// To test transactions locally, you can use the `run-rs` npm module to quickly set up a replica set for testing purposes. Here are the steps to do so:

// 1. **Install `run-rs`:**
//    Use npm to install the `run-rs` package globally:

//    ```bash
//    npm install -g run-rs
//    sudo lsof -i :27017
//    sudo service mongod stop
//    ```

// 2. **Start a Replica Set:**
//    Run the following command in your terminal to start a local replica set with three nodes:

//    ```bash
//    run-rs -v 4.0.0 --shell
//    nohup run-rs -v 4.0.0 --shell & // run forever
//    ```

//    This command will create a replica set with three MongoDB instances (node0, node1, node2), and it will open a MongoDB shell connected to the replica set.

// 3. **Connect Mongoose to the Replica Set:**
//    In your Node.js code, ensure that your Mongoose connection string includes the replica set information. For example:

//    ```javascript
//    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

//    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/your-database?replicaSet=rs', {
//      useNewUrlParser: true,
//      useUnifiedTopology: true
//    });
//    ```

//    Replace `'your-database'` with your actual database name and adjust the connection options as needed.

// 4. **Use Transactions in Mongoose:**
//    With the updated connection string that includes the replica set information, you should be able to use transactions in your Mongoose code without encountering the "Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos" error.

// This setup allows you to test transactions in a local environment by creating a simple replica set using the `run-rs` package and then connecting your Mongoose application to it.






// The error message you're encountering during the installation of the `run-rs` module seems related to the installation of a native dependency (`kerberos`) that's failing due to missing header files. This issue might occur due to missing system dependencies required for building native modules.

// Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and potentially fix this issue:

// ### Step 1: Check System Dependencies

// The `kerberos` package requires system dependencies to build correctly. Ensure you have the necessary system packages installed:

// #### For Ubuntu/Debian:

// ```bash
// sudo apt-get install build-essential libkrb5-dev
// ```

// #### For CentOS/Fedora:

// ```bash
// sudo yum install gcc-c++ krb5-devel
// ```

// ### Step 2: Retry Installation

// After installing the necessary system dependencies, try installing `run-rs` again:

// ```bash
// npm install -g run-rs
// ```

// If the issue persists, you might need to clean npm cache and try the installation again:

// ```bash
// npm cache clean --force
// npm install -g run-rs
// ```

// ### Step 3: Update Node.js and npm

// Ensure you are using the latest stable version of Node.js and npm. You're currently using Node.js version `19.6.1`, which might be relatively newer. Consider using a more stable or LTS version.

// ### Additional Steps:

// 1. **Using NVM:**
//    If you're using Node Version Manager (NVM), ensure you've set the correct default or desired version of Node.js. You might switch to a more stable version and try the installation again.

//    ```bash
//    nvm use <stable_version>
//    ```

// 2. **Error Logs:**
//    Review the logs to get more specific details about the installation failure. The logs are often found at a path similar to `/home/marshal/.npm/_logs/`.

// ### Final Thoughts:

// If the issue persists even after trying these steps, there might be an underlying compatibility issue with the current version of Node.js you're using or an issue with the `kerberos` package itself. In such cases, you might need to seek further support from the package maintainers or consider alternative methods for setting up a MongoDB replica set for testing transactions in Mongoose.
